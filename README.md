I was surprised this doesn't seem to exist in useful form anywhere, so whipped this up.
It makes extensive use of css-variables, which should allow it to adapt to different mobile
devices and OS versions pretty easily. Where possible, I pulled values direct from Apple HIG
or by measuring screenshots.

Based on (but not a fork of) [html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).
